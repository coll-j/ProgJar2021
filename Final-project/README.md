This code tested on Python 3.9.5

I suggest to use virtual environment to prevent overlapping libraries.

## How to run
1. Install requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run server script first; python server.py. **Make sure to use python not python3 because the requirements were installed using pip not pip3**
3. Run client script and pass username argument. Ex: python client.py client-1
